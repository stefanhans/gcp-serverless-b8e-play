### BookAShare

Coming from a car sharing association and its booking application we try to generalize the core idea conceptually.
For this purpose we concentrate on three main functionalities as described in the following files.

1) `BOOKING.md`: The booking of shared goods and services for some time by users. 
2) `BILLING.md`: The billing of users for some time regarding their bookings.
3) `INVESTING.md`: The investments needed for the goods and services to be booked, shared, and billed.

We use `Creative Learning` as procedure to learn and to reach our goals.
